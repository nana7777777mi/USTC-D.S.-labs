Data structures are generally based on the ability of a computer to fetch and
store data at any place in its memory, specified by a pointer-a bit string,
representing a memory address, that can be itself stored in memory and
manipulated by the program. Thus, the array and record data structures are
based on computing the addresses of data items with arithmetic operations,
while the linked data structures are based on storing addresses of data items
within the structure itself.

The implementation of a data structure usually requires writing a set of
procedures that create and manipulate instances of that structure. The
efficiency of a data structure cannot be analyzed separately from those
operations. This observation motivates the theoretical concept of an abstract
data type, a data structure that is defined indirectly by the operations that
may be performed on it, and the mathematical properties of those operations
(including their space and time cost).[9]
